  abstract = {In non-invasive thermal diagnostics, accurate correlations between the thermal image on skin surface and interior human physiology are often desired, which require general solutions for the bioheat equation. In this study an estimation methodology is presented to determine unknown thermophysical or geometrical parameters of a tumor region using the temperature profile on the skin surface that may be obtained by infrared thermography. To solve these inverse problems a second order finite difference scheme was implemented to solve the bioheat Pennes equation with mixed boundary conditions in two and three dimensions. Then, the Pattern Search algorithm was used to estimate the different parameters by minimizing a fitness function involving the temperature profiles obtained from simulated or clinical data to those obtained by the finite different scheme.},

  abstract = {In this work, an attempt is made to simulate the skin temperature profile of breasts in the presence of Cysts. For the first time a study comparing the temperature profiles of normal breasts with Breast Cysts is undertaken. Heat transfer mechanism is modelled as the Penne's Bio-heat equation on 2D breast sections. The equation is solved using the Finite Element Method. The Cysts are simulated for typical depths and sizes. It is observed that for Cysts at depths greater than 5 cm and of sizes less than 0.5 cm the effect on the surface temperature is negligible. It is also found that in all configurations surface temperature drops. Cyst of maximum radius when placed closest to the skin surface, the temperature declines the most. Therefore this study seems to help in reducing the false positive rate during screening and in the early diagnosis of breast cancer using infrared imaging.},

  abstract = {A theoretical study on vascularized skin model to predict the thermal evaluation criteria of early melanoma using the dynamic thermal imaging technique is presented in this article. Thermographic evaluation of melanoma has been carried out during the thermal recovery of skin from undercooled condition. During thermal recovery, the skin has been exposed to natural convection, radiation, and evaporation. The thermal responses of melanoma have been evaluated by integrating the bioheat model for multi-layered skin with the momentum as well as energy conservation equations for blood flow. Differential changes in the surface thermal response of various melanoma stages except that of the early stage have been determined. It has been predicted that the thermal response due to subsurface blood flow overpowers the response of early melanoma. Hence, the study suggests that the quantification of early melanoma diagnosis using thermography has not reached a matured stage yet. Therefore, the study presents a systematic analysis of various intermediate melanoma stages to determine the thermal evaluation criteria of early melanoma. The comprehensive modeling effort made in this work supports the prediction of the disease outcome and relates the thermal response with the variation in patho-physiological, thermal and geometrical parameters.},

Human Body temperature distribution is an indicator of health condition, the brain tumor cells generate more heat than normal brain cells due to their higher metabolism and their vascular dilation. Heat distribution in human body is modeled using Pennes BioHeat Transfer Equation (PBHTE) solved by Finite Volume Method (FVM), and with the inverse analysis using Genetic Algorithm (GA) we will estimate the size and location of brain tumor, with this way Level Set Method extracts tumors contours with more accuracy and efficiency. To our knowledge, this is the first approach which introduces thermal analysis to improve the accuracy of segmentation and extraction of tumors in MRI images.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the transient thermal response of skin layers to determine to which extent the surface temperature distribution reflects the properties of subsurface structures, such as benign or malignant lesions. Specifically, we conduct a detailed sensitivity analysis to interpret the changes in the surface temperature distribution as a function of variations in thermophysical properties, blood perfusion rate, metabolic heat generation and thicknesses of skin layers, using a multilayer computational model. These properties can vary from individual to individual or depend on location, external and internal influences, and in certain situations accurate property data are not available in the literature. Therefore, the uncertainties in these data could potentially affect the accuracy of the interpretation/diagnosis of a lesion in a clinical setting. In this study, relevant parameters were varied within characteristic physiological ranges, and differences in the surface temperature response were quantified. It was observed that variations in these parameters have a small influence on the surface temperature distribution. Analysis using this multilayer model was further conducted to determine the sensitivity of transient thermal response to different lesion sizes. This work validates the idea of examining the transient thermal response obtained using a thermal imaging system with the objective of lesion identification. The modeling effort and the sensitivity analysis reported in this paper comprise a portion of a comprehensive research effort involving experimentation on a skin phantom model as well as measurements on patients in a clinical setting, that are currently underway. One of the preliminary results from the ongoing clinical trial is also included to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {The present work is concerned with the development and application of dual phase lag (DPL) based heat conduction model for investigating the thermal response of laser-irradiated biological tissue phantoms. The developed heat transfer model has been coupled with the transient form of radiative transfer equation (RTE) that describes the phenomena of light propagation inside the tissue phantom. The RTE has been solved using the discrete ordinate method (DOM) to determine the 2-D distribution of light intensity within the tissue phantom, while finite volume method (FVM) based discretization scheme has been employed for solving the heat transfer model. The developed numerical model has first been verified against the results available in the literature. The results obtained in the form of temperature distribution through DPL model have been compared with conventional Fourier heat conduction model as well as with hyperbolic model. The effects of two phase lags terms in the form of relaxation times i.e. {$\tau$}T and {$\tau$}q associated with DPL model on the resultant thermal profiles have been investigated. Thereafter, the temperature distribution inside the biological tissue phantom embedded with optical inhomogeneities of varying contrast levels have been determined using the DPL-based model. Here the optical inhomogeneities represent the malignant (absorbing inhomogeneity) and benign (scattering inhomogeneity) cells present in an otherwise homogeneous medium. Results of the study reveal that the hyperbolic heat conduction model consistently predicts high temperature values and also the associated thermal profiles exhibit the largest amplitude of oscillations throughout the body of the tissue phantom. The DPL-based model results into relatively lesser oscillations due to the coupled effects of {$\tau$}T and {$\tau$}q. The conventional Fourier model, on the other hand, results into the lowest temperature values without any oscillations in the temperature profiles. The effect of the presence of varying nature of optical inhomogeneities is also brought out quite clearly using the developed DPL-based heat conduction model.},

Living tissue is highly nonhomogenous, and the effect of local non-equilibrium on the thermal behavior should be accounted. Therefore, this work uses the dual-phase-lag model to analyze thermal response for estimating thermal damage in laser-irradiated biological tissue. The transport behavior of laser light in the tissue is assumed as highly absorbed and strongly scattered, respectively. Thermal damage is assessed with the rate process equation. The effects of blood perfusion and metabolic heat generation on thermal response and thermal damage are explored. The reliability of the present results has been evidenced through comparison with the literature. The results show the DPL bio-heat transfer equation with the effect of blood perfusion, even with the space-dependent source term, can be reduced to the Fourier bio-heat transfer equation for sq = sT.},

Since the execution of the three-dimensional model requires a large amount of time, CUDA is used to speedup it. Experimental results showed that the parallelization with CUDA was very effective in improving performance, yielding gains up to 242 times when compared to the sequential execution time.},

  abstract = {We recently initiated a program aimed to investigate the suitability of dynamic infrared imaging for following-up nodular melanoma patients treated with BNCT. The reason that makes infrared imaging attractive is the fact that it constitutes a functional and non-invasive imaging method, providing information on the normal and abnormal physiologic response of the nervous and vascular systems, as well as the local metabolic rate and inflammatory processes that ultimately appear as differences in the skin temperature. An infrared camera, with a focal plane array of 320\texttimes 240 uncooled ferroelectric detectors is employed, which provides a video stream of the infrared emission in the 7\textendash 14{$\mu$}m wavelength band. A double blackbody is used as reference for absolute temperature calibration. After following a protocol for patient preparation and acclimatization, a basal study is performed. Subsequently, the anatomic region of interest is subjected to a provocation test (a cold stimulus), which induces an autonomic vasoconstriction reflex in normal structures, thus enhancing the thermal contrast due to the differences in the vasculature of the different skin regions. Radiation erythema reactions and melanoma nodules possess typically a faster temperature recovery than healthy, non-irradiated skin. However, some other non-pathological structures are also detectable by infrared imaging, (e.g. scars, vessels, arteriovenous anastomoses and injuries), thus requiring a multi-study comparison in order to discriminate the tumor signal. Besides the superficial nodules, which are readily noticeable by infrared imaging, we have detected thermal signals that are coincident with the location of non-palpable nodules, which are observable by CT and ultrasound. Diffuse regions of fast temperature recovery after a cold stimulus were observed between the third and sixth weeks post-BNCT, concurrent with the clinical manifestation of radiation erythema. The location of the erythematous visible and infrared regions is consistent with the 3D dosimetry calculations.},

Two, the heat transfer rate from blood vessels to tissue was modeled without following a vessel path. Three, the model applied to any unheated and heated tissue. To meet these criteria, a generic bioheat transfer model (BHTM) was derived here by conserving thermal energy in a heated vascularized finite tissue and by making a few simplifying assumptions. Two linear coupled differential equations were obtained with the following two variables: tissue volume averaged temperature and blood volume averaged temperature. The generic model was compared with the widely employed empirical Pennes' BHTM. The comparison showed that the Pennes' perfusion term wCp(1-{$\epsilon$}) should be interpreted as a local vasculature dependent heat transfer coefficient term. Suggestions are presented for further adaptations of the general BHTM for specific tissues using imaging techniques and numerical simulations.},

Numerical simulations of the canine knee in a thermal neutrality condition were performed using the ANSYS-CFX\textregistered{} program. The simulation results were compared with experimental in vivo data. The smaller percentage differences between the experimental and simulated in vivo results were found in simulations that used the blood flow rate as a function of temperature.

  abstract = {Abstract, Breast cancer is the number one killer disease among women. It is known that early detection of a tumour ensures better prognosis and higher survival rate. In this paper an intelligent, inexpensive and non-invasive diagnostic tool is developed for aiding breast cancer detection objectively. This tool is based on thermographic scanning of the breast surface in conjunction with numerical simulation of the breast using the bioheat equation. The medical applications of thermographic scanning make use of the skin temperature as an indication of an underlying pathological process. The thermal pattern over a breast tumour reflects the vascular reaction to the abnormality. Hence an abnormal temperature pattern may be an indicator of an underlying tumour., Seven important parameters are identified and analysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed using a 2n design (n = number of parameters, 7). The effect and importance of the various parameters are analysed. Based on the above 27 design, the Taguchi method is used to optimize the parameters in order to ensure the signal from the tumour maximized compared with the noise from the other factors. The model predicts that the ideal setting for capturing the signal from the tumour is when the patient is at basal metabolic activity with a correspondingly lower subcutaneous perfusion in a low temperature environment.},

Operation of the instrument in three media with known thermal properties shows the uncertainty of measurements to be about 2\%. The reproducibility is 0.5\% for the thermal-conductivity measurements and 2\% for the thermal-diffusivity measurements. Thermal properties were measured in dog, pig, rabbit, and human tissues. The tissues included kidney, spleen, liver, brain, heart, lung, pancreas, colon cancer, and breast cancer. Thermal properties were measured for 65 separate tissue samples at 3, 10, 17, 23, 30, 37, and 45\textdegree C.

Pennes in Volume 1 of the Journal of Applied Physiology defined the theoretical basis for a considerable body of analysis performed by many investigators during the ensuing half century. However, during the past decade, the Pennes' model of heat transfer in perfused tissue has been criticized for various reasons, one of which is that his own experimental data seemed to be at variance with the model. More specifically, the shape of the mean temperature-depth relationship measured by Pennes was distinctly different from the shape of the theoretical curve. In this paper, I show that Pennes used an inappropriate procedure to analyze his data and that, when the data are analyzed in a more rigorous manner, they support his theory. Additional support for Pennes' theory is provided by the experimental data of H. Barcroft and O. G. Edholm [ J. Physiol.

It is proposed that a detailed understanding of the coupled biological-mechanical response under thermal agitation will contribute to the design, characterization, and optimization of strategies for delivering better treatment. For a comprehensive understanding on the underlying mechanisms of thermomechanical behavior of skin tissue, recent progress on bioheat transfer, thermal damage, thermomechanics, and thermal pain should be systematically reviewed. This article focuses on the transfer of heat through skin tissue. Experimental study, theoretical analysis, and numerical modeling of skin thermal behavior are reviewed, with theoretical analysis carried out and closed-form solutions obtained for simple one-layer Fourier theory based model. Non-Fourier bioheat transfer models for skin tissue are discussed, and various skin cooling technologies summarized. Finally, the predictive capacity of various heat transfer models is demonstrated with selected case studies.},
